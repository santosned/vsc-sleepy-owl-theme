# Sleepy Owl Theme

> ðŸ¦‰ Collection of dark themes for coding overnight.

This project aims to provide a high-quality collection of dark color themes for [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode), with subtle vibrant colors, smooth contrast, as well as a consistent color palette, the themes ought to have a professional appearance. All of this is to improve coding productivity and readability, especially for overnight code development.

## Customizing

The easiest way to create a new custom color theme is to start with an existing color theme and customize it with your personal config file. See more in [Color Theme - Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme) extension guide.

This is useful if you want to do an small tweak but you don't want to worry about clone, fork, debugging, and testing.
